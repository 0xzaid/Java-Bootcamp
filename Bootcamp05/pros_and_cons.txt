Throwing Exceptions and static factory method
from the ease of use and capability point of view.

Pros of Throwing Exceptions
    - Groups similar types of bugs together.
    - Separates error handling code from regular code
    - use of "throws" keyword, then specify exception
    - Easier to use than static factory methods, dont have to create a new method


Cons of Throwing Exceptions
    - if not handled, program quits


Pros of static factory method
    - can have different name than constructors
    - can be invoked without creating a new instance of class
    - they reduce the verbosity of creating parameterized type instance

Cons of static factory method
    - classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed
    - harder to use than throwing exceptions, need to create a new method and then change everywhere
      we that class is instantiated
